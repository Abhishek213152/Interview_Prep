{"title": "Island Perimeter with Bridges", "difficulty": "Easy", "description": "You are given a representation of an island as a grid where '1' represents land and '0' represents water.  An island may have bridges connecting different landmasses. A bridge is defined as a horizontal or vertical path of '1's connecting two or more separate landmasses.  Write a function that calculates the total perimeter of the island, *including the perimeter of the bridges themselves*.  Note that a bridge adds to the total perimeter, not just the perimeter of the individual landmasses it connects.", "examples": [{"input": "`grid = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0]]`", "output": "12", "explanation": "The island has a perimeter of 12. The two landmasses are connected by a bridge, adding to the total perimeter."}, {"input": "`grid = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`", "output": "12", "explanation": "There are four separate landmasses each with a perimeter of 4, thus a total perimeter of 12.
