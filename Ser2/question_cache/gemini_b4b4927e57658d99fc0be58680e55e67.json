{"title": "Island Perimeter with Bridges", "difficulty": "Easy", "category": "graphs", "description": "You are given a map represented as a grid where '1' represents land and '0' represents water.  An island is a group of connected '1's (horizontally or vertically).  A bridge is a connection between two islands.  Calculate the total perimeter of all islands, *excluding* the perimeter formed by bridges.", "examples": [{"input": "```\ngrid = [\n  [1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [1, 0, 1, 0],\n  [0, 1, 1, 1],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```", "output": "12", "explanation": "There are two islands. The first island (top-left) has a perimeter of 8 (4 sides of the 2x2 block), and the second (bottom-right) has a perimeter of 4.  However, the two islands are connected by a bridge reducing the total perimeter.  The total perimeter considering this bridge is 12 (8 + 4 - 2*bridge connections = 12)."}, {"input": "```\ngrid = [\n  [1, 1, 1],\n  [0, 1, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1]\n]\n```", "output": "12", "explanation": "A single island with a perimeter of 12."}, {"input": "```\ngrid = [\n    [1,0,1],\n    [0,0,0],\n    [1,0,1]\n]\n```", "output": "8", "explanation": "Two islands, each with a perimeter of 4, for a total of 8.
