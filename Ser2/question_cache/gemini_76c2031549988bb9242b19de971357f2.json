{"title": "Stack-Based Integer Palindrome Checker", "difficulty": "Easy", "category": "stacks", "description": "Write a function that determines if a given positive integer is a palindrome using only a stack data structure.  You are not allowed to convert the integer to a string.  Your function should push digits onto the stack and then compare them during popping to determine the palindrome property.", "examples": [{"input": "121", "output": "True", "explanation": "The digits are pushed onto the stack (1, 2, 1).  Popping the stack compares 1 == 1, then 2 == 2, then 1 == 1.  Therefore, it's a palindrome."}, {"input": "123", "output": "False", "explanation": "The digits are pushed onto the stack (1, 2, 3). Popping gives 3, 2, 1. The comparison fails (3 != 1).  Therefore, it's not a palindrome."}, {"input": "1001", "output": "True", "explanation": "The digits are pushed onto the stack (1, 0, 0, 1). Popping gives 1, 0, 0, 1.  The comparison confirms a palindrome.\n\n\nConstraints:\n- The input integer will always be a positive integer.\n- The input integer will be within the range of a 32-bit integer.\n- You must use a stack data structure to solve this problem.
